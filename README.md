# python-cli-reddit-browser
This is a command line tool that lets you browse reddit. It does not support color yet but it will soon.
This can be used for browsing reddit in command line only computers or you can use it at work without raising any of the eyebrows that the website raises since the command line tool looks makes it look like you are doing work.

**Instructions:**
1:
You should edit the python name in the file */manifest.tx*. This will be used to run the programs.
This can be done by opening the file and then changing the value that comes after "*pythonname=*". EX: "*pythonname=py.exe*" or "*pythonname=python3*".
If you run the program and then get an error such as "*sh: 1: PROGRAMNAME: not found*" or "*'abcd' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.*" that is because you did not correctly fix that line. It is set to "*python*" as a default, however you should set it to whatever program you use to run your python scripts.
2:
Run the program */installRequiredModules.py*. This will install all the needed packages for this program so that you dont have to go through that mess.
3:
To run the browser command line, run the program */python-cli-reddit-browser.py*. Type "*help.py*" for a list of commands.

**Troubleshooting:**
1:
Read through this readme fully, the answer is probably here.
2:
Raise an issue on this github repository, I should answer you pretty soon.

# Enjoy!
