# python-cli-reddit-browser
This is a command line tool that lets you browse reddit. It does not support color yet but it will soon.
This can be used for browsing reddit in command line only computers or you can use it at work without raising any of the eyebrows that the website raises since the command line tool looks makes it look like you are doing work.
